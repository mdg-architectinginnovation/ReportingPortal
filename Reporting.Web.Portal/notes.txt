Portal = Flat Admin V.2 Bootstrap Template

Template URL:
https://github.com/tui2tone/flat-admin-bootstrap-templates

* jQuery version that comes with Flat Admin V.2 is newer than the VS2015 version

* Bootstrap version that comes with Flat Admin V.2 is newer than the VS2015 version

*Char.js js file was in dist, the original path is incorrect

Keep an eye out:
1) Left jquery.validate in BundleConfig (decided to remove but didn't fix my 3 remaining js errors)

2) Left respond.js in the BundleConfig

3) The font urls at the top of index.html.  Find out if you need them and how to download them locally

4) Template was missing so closing divs at the end, so I added them

5) Went ahead and removed site.css bundle

6) Removed modernizr
